## ObjectCollection


</div>

### Description

This is a Collection replacement, limiting itself to objects. This is mostly a usable "technology demo", showcasing how to create a feature full syntax compatible replacement of a Collection. By speed this class only competes in a few areas, being much slower in adding new items for an example. Maybe someone takes this over and makes a syntax compatible version that is much faster.

Features: Add, Clear, Clone, Count, Index, IndexByPtr, Item, ItemByIndex, ItemByKey, ItemByPtr, Items, Key, KeyByPtr, Keys, Ptrs, Remove, RemoveByIndex, RemoveByKey, RemoveByPtr, Swap, SwapByIndex, SwapByKey and SwapByPtr. As you can guess by this listing of features, you can do a whole lot more than you can do with the native Collection (which only has Add, Count, Item and Remove).

Based on SelfEnum class posted yesterday. Credits to Paul Caton and LaVolpe for their work on SelfCallback.
